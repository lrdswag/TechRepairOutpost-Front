        Tech Repair Outpost was first opened during the struggling times of COVID-19.
        My main objective is to provide a high quality service with a very reasonable repair time.
        <hr />
        I aim to always have high quality parts in stock, resulting in less waiting and being without your device.
        In the event your device can not be fixed right away, you will receive a quote for your repair, which can be used
        at a later date when the parts are available.

        I first started getting my experience repairing electronic devices during Work Placement during School.
        The work-placement involved working in a iMac repair center based in Queensland for a period of time.
        After this, I set out and traveled while performing any type of repairs needed for family, friends and myself.
        <hr />
        Upon moving to Melbourne VIC, I was employed by high traffic repair center located in the heart of the CBD.
        This gave me a wealth of valuable experience repairing iPhone and Samsung devices
        in a high pressure and fast paced environment.
        Ready for my next big move, I travelled back to warm and sunny Queensland.
        I first began working for a mobile repair shop before then taking the opportunity
        working with Australia's largest gaming retailer. This further expanded my skills by exposing me all gaming consoles
        sold by their refurbishment center.
        <hr />
        After learning all that I could, I thirsted to learn more and began working
        with a repair company that specialized in repairing Mac's as well as PC's.
        Thanks to this, I was able to learn and master HDD Data Recovery.
        Whilst all this was taking place, I always longed to have my own small business.
        Thanks to the skills and knowledge I have gained, I am lucky enough to say that I am now
        open for business and I can't wait to see you in store!
